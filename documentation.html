      <blockquote>Design decisions and patterns for this web prototype were made in conjunction with background and user research and early ideation established during the web proposal. These patterns and principles would guide future design decisions related with the accessibility and responsiveness of the website.</blockquote>
			<p>In referencing the mock-ups, a design precedence was established and would influence the web elements used to achieve a similar outcome. However, in some instances, a discrepancy between the desired look and the achieved outcome was evident, due to constraints surrounding inexperience using scripts. In these cases, alternative designs were considered and tested to achieve comparable results.</p>
      <p>With the benefit of hindsight, the decision to simplify the overall layout and web structure of my design brief was taken as a means of achieving a more cohesive and realistic end product. The charity chosen would have a team of front-end developers working on the website and thus, the possibility and scope of what is delivered far exceeds the capabilities of a sole web designer. Thus, it was decided that the About us and Media page would be excluded from the final design and instead, be incorporated into other web pages where possible.</p>
      <p>The following section is a comparison between the design mock-up and the final design incorporated into the web prototype</p>

			<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
      <p>Following feedback given during the web proposal stage, a more direct approach was taken for the navigation of the website. Instead of the proposed navigation design, a menu icon was incorporated as an intuitive symbol for page navigation. CSS animations would also be incorporated for a smoother transition when the navigation bar pops out from the left.</p>

			<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As a means of engaging the target user group and encourage web interaction, the home page was of crucial importance to the websites design.</li>
        <li>In keeping things simple and easy to use, parallax scrolling was a good option to incorporate visual imagery with textual prompts that were aimed at enticing the user to commit to an action of signing up to participate by the end of the page.</li>
        <li>For a sense of urgency, the countdown timer was altered to be larger and to show more prominently within the page design</li>
      </ul>
      <a class="button"href="index.html">Home page</a>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/documentation/designs/home mockup.png"/>
        <figcaption>This is a mockup of the home page.</figcaption>
      </figure>  
			<h3 id="participate">Participate</h3>
      <p>In contrast to the mock-up, the countdown element was removed from this particular page. In addition, the content layout with the image and text floating to the right of the image was altered in favour of filling out the white space for more immersion into the charity. This way your eye is not competing for attention between textual and visual prompts.</p>
        <p>
        The participation element of the page remained predominantly the same, except for the incorporation of cartoon depictions of each event to match the logo motif. Content for each tab referenced existing Movember material. Under the resource’s panels, it was decided that Movember content would be incorporated through button links in the final iteration of the design.</p>
         <a class="button"href="participate.html">Participate page</a>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/documentation/designs/participate mockup.png"/>
        <figcaption>This is a mockup of the participate page.</figcaption>
      </figure>  
			<h3 id="donate"><u>Donate</u></h3>
      <p>Within the article section of content, the same approach was taken for consistency as the previous page. Additionally, the tab system was implemented as the easiest means of distinguishing prospective donors. A key design challenge was the need to incorporate a multi-step process of searching for participants/teams and displaying profiles that would not be needed in a typical charity donation. As such, implementation of this search process was replaced by a search bar to avoid future complications. For some reason, replit has trouble loading the multi-step form so a link to the codepen has been provided here:  </p>

      </figure>  
			<h3 id="work we fund"><u>Work we fund</u></h3>
      <p>The work we fund page remained predominately the same except for the colour coding approach used to distinguish elements from each category of funding.
      </p>
      <a class="button"href="work-we-fund.html">Work We Fund page</a>
