          </p>
          <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
          <p>This 3 part documentary came about through a collaboration between the Movember Foundation, the University of Melbourne and Heiress Films.</p>
          <p>It was designed as a large-scale intervention to challenge masculine norms and encourage men to lower their guard and reach out to others when times are tough.</p>
          <p>The documentary was screened by the ABC in primetime over three consecutive weeks in October and November 2016. In addition, there has been subsequent screenings on the ABC and other platforms such as Stan. </p>

          <h4>Project Overview</h4>
          <p>MindMax is a digital community where people can discover, play and share ideas to build their psychological fitness. </p>
          <p>MindMax uses sport, videogames and wellbeing science to engage Australian men aged 16 to 35 in a digital community that aims to improve mental health outcomes.</p>
          <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
          <p>The MindMax platform aims to digitally connect boys and men with wellbeing education and in a safe, playful and engaging environment. </p>
          <p>The project consists of three components: <ol>
              <li>The gaming component, "Mind Games", will draw on commercially available games to encourage competition and the sharing of game experiences</li>
              <li>The education component, Mind Mechanics”, will be shared digitally allowing an individual user to complete a self-directed course or another format that encourages group learning.
              </li>
              <li>The Our Story component will be provided by AFL players "sharing positive wellbeing stories and messages about behaviours that help them manage the highs and lows of life, on and off the playing field"</li>

            AUD 17,135,647.00
          </p>
          <h4>Project Overview</h4>
          <p>The Prostate Cancer Outcomes - Registry Australia and New Zealand (PCOR-ANZ) aims to establish a bi-national population-based registry of men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. </p>
          <p>This database will build evidence that supports risk adjusted feedback reports for hospitals and clinicians with the overarching goal of delivering improved quality of treatment and care to patients</p>
          <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
          <p>The objective of the registry is to routinely capture data for 90% of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases annually.</p>
          <p>
            PCOR-ANZ produces a publicly available Annual Report of patient reported outcomes linked to treatment and is overseen by a Steering Committee consisting of clinicians, registry custodians, administrators, an epidemiologist and prostate cancer survivors.

        <h4>IRONMAN PROMs Sub-study</h4>
        <p>Movember Funding to Date
          AUD 250,000
        </p>
        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>The IRONMAN PROMs sub-study seeks to test the concept that using PROMs (Patient Reported Outcome Measures) to trigger clinical intervention as part of care for men with advanced prostate cancer can achieve a quality of life and survival advantage.</p>
        <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
        <p>Men with advanced prostate cancer who enrol in this study will complete a monthly intervention assessment, in addition to the global IRONMAN study assessments. </p>
        <p>Depending on a man’s responses to the intervention assessment, which provides an indication of distress in the domains of anxiety, pain, fatigue, social isolation, or depression - a ‘soft’ or ‘hard’ trigger will be released</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At a soft trigger, self-management content curated by Movember will be presented. </li>
          <li>At a ‘hard’ trigger, the man’s clinical team will receive a message that the man requires medical attention, in addition to the self-management content. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This study will help us better understand the experiences of men with advanced prostate cancer, build the evidence base for best practices for prostate cancer care, and contribute to the understanding of how to integrate PROMs into real time care.

        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>TrueNTH Testicular cancer aims to provide resources for men who facing a diagnosis and early treatment for testicular cancer</p>
        <p>This resource helps men navigate the early stages of treatment and facilitates peer support from survivors who have lived through the same experiences.</p>
        <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
        <p>Currently, there is an unmet need whereby men do not resonate with the information that they have access to. To this end, the delivery of this project will give men platform to reach out to a community</p>
        <p>To achieve this vision, the project has a few aims: <ul>
            <li>Testing and development of current and planned features</li>
            <li>The design of new and engaging content to encourage greater usage</li>
            <li>Innovation around new features that will make the process of diagnosis and early treatment more tolerable</li>

        <p>Movember Funding to Date
          AUD 660, 745</p>
        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>For a small number of men, testicular cancer is not as easily treated and may lead to poorer outcome in terms of overall survival and side effects of more toxic treatments.
          The trial strives to guide future clinical practice and shape medical treatment for men who are not effectively treated during the first round of chemotherapy
        </p>
        <h4>Project Desrciption</h4>
        <p>TIGER trial aspires to assess what type of treatment is most effective for testicular cancer. Given that relapse after chemotherapy is quite rare in testicular cancer, a large number of recruiting centres are required to efficiently accrue patients into the study. </p>
